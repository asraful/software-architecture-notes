 ## [core intent of clean architecture](https://herbertograca.com/2017/09/28/clean-architecture-standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants) 

- independence of tools 
- independence of delivery mechanisms
- testibility in isolation

## Back in 2008, Jeffrey Palermo defined [four tenets of Onion Architecture:](https://jeffreypalermo.com/tag/onion-architecture/)


- The application is built around an independent object model
- Inner layers define interfaces.  Outer layers implement interfaces
- Direction of coupling is toward the center
- All application core code can be compiled and run separate from infrastructure
